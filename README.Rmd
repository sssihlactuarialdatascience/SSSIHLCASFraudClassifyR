SSSIHLCASFraudClassifyR is one of the outputs of the 2022 CAS( Casualty Actuarial Society) Individual Grant Award Project given to Sri Sathya Sai Institue of Higher Learning (SSSIHL).

The objective of the project is to provide a framework where actuarial inputs can be integrated into Machine Learning models to improve fraud detection and more importantly, make business sense of the outcomes.

The package contains various functions that add flags to the claims data based on different criteria. These flags can in turn be used by users as inputs into any statistical or machine learning models. In short, we infuse actuarial/insurance/behavioral triggers as a feature engineering step of the model development. You will find various vignettes in the package that illustrate model fitting process and quantify the improvement in model fit due to the addition of these triggers.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SSSIHLCASFraudClassifyR like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/sssihlactuarialdatascience/SSSIHLCASFraudClassifyR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example for adding fraud trigger to your claims data using the package. Claim amount trigger is a ratio of the actual paid claim amount and the procedure amount. For cashless claims, cost of the procedure is often agreed between insurer and medical service provider upfront.



```{r}
library(SSSIHLCASFraudClassifyR)
library(dplyr)

data("claims_data_sample")
data("trigger_data")

claims_data_sample <-
  claim_amount_trigger_map(
    claims_file = claims_data_sample,
    claim_paid_field = "approved_allowed_amount",
    triggers_file = trigger_data,
    procedure_code = "primary_procedure_code",
    procedure_amount_field = "package_amount_trigger"
  )

```

```{r }
summary(claims_data_sample$claim_amount_ratio)
```

For those claims where the ratio is higher than 1, it must be investigated further to understand the reasons. It could be an indication of fraud by the medical service provider - that the medical service provider has levied additional charges for the procedure that are otherwise not required or agreed with contractually.


Once you map triggers to the data, these fields can be used as explanatory variables in fraud detection and classification models. In the package vignettes, we have demonstrated how triggers can be added to health insurance data to significantly improve predictability of various Machine learning and Statistical models.
